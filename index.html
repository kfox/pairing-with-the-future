            If your project or team is big enough, or your software is useful enough, your code will eventually be seen by other people. More importantly, it will probably need to be understood and changed by some of those other people. That means someone else, or maybe even you 6 months in the future, will need to read and understand your code.

              Functions should do one thing and do it well.
            </li>
            <li>
              The same inputs should always give the same outputs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid sharing or changing state.
            </li>
            <li>

          <h2>Arity: The number of function arguments</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Try to keep the number of function arguments to three or less. It can be difficult to remember argument order when two or more arguments are required.
            </li>
            <li>
              If more arguments are needed, pass an “options” object as the last function argument.
              An options object as the last function argument allows you to change the number of arguments without refactoring all references to that function.

            <li>
              Describing curious code that you were forced to include for non-obvious reasons, e.g. to circumvent a known bug or deal with a poorly-written API. (Include a link to the issue.)
            </li>
            <li>

              Don’t be afraid to create one-line functions.

              If your code and tests are written with clarity, you won’t need extensive documentation.

            <li>
              Leverage tools to document the code for you.

          <h2>Tools for success</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use linters to catch errors as you type and before you commit code to source control.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use “beautifiers” to format code according to agreed-upon conventions, e.g. Prettier for JavaScript, Flake8 for Python, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use syntax highlighting in your IDE to help identify code components.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use an IDE that integrates all of the above tools either automatically or with little effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use static type-checking if that’s an option.
            </li>

          <h2>Choosing new tools or frameworks</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keep an open mind. Just because a tool or framework is popular does not necessarily mean it’s the best solution for your problem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find out what other people are using or creating, and why. Read books, blogs, and newsletters. Listen to podcasts. Watch videos. Go to meetups and conferences.
